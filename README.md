# 🎮 CodeAlpha Hangman Game

A simple Hangman game implemented in Python as part of an internship task at **Code Alpha**. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player attempts to guess it one letter at a time. The player has up to **6 incorrect guesses** before the game ends.


## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. A series of underscores will appear, representing the secret word.
3. Enter one letter per guess.
4. Correct guesses reveal the letter(s) in the word.
5. Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts.
6. The game ends when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
